# HomeAssistantBlueprints
This is a repo of all my blueprints for Home Assistant. 

If you want to contribute, please make a pull request which I will merge and implement into the blueprint. 

If you have any problems, you can rise an issue on Github. I do not offer support, but will look into issues when/if I have time. This is a project I do in my spare time (like the most of us) so my time is limited, but I will try to maintain these blueprints as often as possible. 

Maintainers are welcome. Please write me a message and prove your experience with Git, HA etc. and I will look into it.
